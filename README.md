<h3> Made as the Final for my intro to web fundamentals class (2019).</h3>

This was made using <strong> HTML</strong> and <strong> CSS</strong> with a few lines of embedded <strong> javascript</strong>.

It is a simple art portfolio I made for myself, I did pretty good I think, but I'd like to recreate this someday once my skills have improved further.
I struggled with the placement of the text within the flexboxes (unless I'm mistaken), but the text is there.
