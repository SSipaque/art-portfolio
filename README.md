# art-portfolio
Made as the Final for my intro to web fundamentals class (2019).

This was made using <em> HTML </em> and CSS with a few lines of embedded javascript.

It is a simple art portfolio I made for myself, I did pretty good I think, but I'd like to recreate this someday once my skills have improved further.
I struggled with the placement of the text within the flexboxes (unless I'm mistaken), but the text is there.
