    <span id= "output">    My name is Stephannie Sipaque, I am from Plainfield, New Jersey. I am the
   oldest child out of three, I have two younger brothers. I am currently a 
   student at The College of New Jersey where I am studying to become a web 
   developer. I am a self-taught artist who does digital and traditional art. I
   have been drawing since I can remember, I have always loved art and cartoons.
   I draw with various mediums such as watercolor, pencil, markers, colored pencils,
   and oil pastels just to name a few. I especially enjoy drawing characters and am
   capable of drawing in different styles, but I prefer more stylized art as they 
   tend to be more fun for me to make.</span>
